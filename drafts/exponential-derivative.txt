I consider exposition, a narrative, and a storyline very important to teaching; 
a perspective I've held since I came to love mathematical pedagogy, 
but was only articulated once I heard Brandon Wu articulate and express the same.

In this light, calculus was a great course for 3b1b to exposit on; 
other than a few initial glaze overs and assumptions about the actual mechanics of derivatives of integrals,
the course is largely self contained; with results building upon previous results.

One glaring exception is the derivative of the exponential function, upon which other results are built.

In this article, I aim not to rigorously prove the aforementioned differentiation, (which would be extremely inaccessible to the relevant audience, and takes a nuke to a nail)
but to illuminate in a way that is convincing in much the same way that an advanced high school student or undergraduate
can "intuitively" believe it to be true (in much the same way analogies and paradigms about derivatives and integrals are accepted).

Here we go!

Two principles we need here:

let c \in \R, f \in \D^0(\R). Then, (cf)' = c f', and if g(x) = f(x - c), then g'(c) = f'(0). 


TBD rest of the math, maybe a visual/geometric argument as well
TBD search for f'(0) = 1?

From here, we can prove that (ln)' = x -> 1/x, and independently from series/sequences, we have that it converges everywhere. 
From this, we can approximate e given the desired property extremely well.
