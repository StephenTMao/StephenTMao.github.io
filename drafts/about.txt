Academic Interests

Within mathematics and computer science, 
I specifically enjoy functional programming, programming languages, compilers, 
graph theory, and pedagogy!

A lot of my personal opinions/thoughts/stances on mathematical pedagogy (which by my definition includes computer science pedagogy)

If you have questions/comments/concerns, I encourage you to reach out to me!

I used to be fluent in Spanish thanks to a good Spanish education in high school, which I subsequently lost in COVID. 
I intend to change that fact (and also attain true fluency in Mandarin), and hopefully you'll be here to see it!
